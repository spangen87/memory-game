# Teddy Memory Game
This is a Memory Game that has been inspired from my daughters stuffed animals. It is a simple but yet challenging memory game with eight pairs of cards.

The game targets to be a fun and challenging way to learn concentrate and remembering things for children. But it also a nice way for adults to relax.
