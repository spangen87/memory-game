# Teddy Memory Game
This is a Memory Game that has been inspired from my daughters stuffed animals. It is a simple but yet challenging memory game with eight pairs of cards.

The game targets to be a fun and challenging way to learn to concentrate and remembering things for children. But it also a nice way for adults to relax.

Welcome to [Teddy Memory Game](https://spangen87.github.io/memory-game/).

## User Experience (UX)
### Wireframes
The wireframes was made before the project started to guide the design. Some changes are made to the final version of the game.

### Site Structure
The Teddy Memory Game is a one page applictaion. All buttons and actions are avilable from the screen without the need to scroll. The start menu is a div that will be hidden when the game starts, and the game will be hidden when you enter the menu. The structure keeps the game in focus, and other elements are planned to minimalistic.

### Design Choices
#### Typography
For the logo of the game, I choosed Courgette. I Wanted a classy but yet playful look so I thought Courgette was a good font for that purpose. 

For the rest of the text I choosed Varela Round. It is easy to read, stylish and still a litlle bit playful.

#### Colors
I choosed colors with my daughers favourite color in mind, pink. [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) was used to pick a palette that I used through the application.

For the text on the buttons a had to use a darker color for readability. I used a darker color of brown (#5C483D).

### Future Features
- A feature that could be added is that you can chose a nickname and that the score can be saved. That could add a competitive element to the game if you can compare scores with other users.
- Adding more levels of difficulty.
- Adding sound effects to the card flipping animation that can make it come more to life.

- Mozilla Firefox is tested through the development process and there is no known issues.
- Microsoft Edge is tested in different resolutions with no known issues.
- Safari is only tested on mobile devices and there is no known issues in that browser.

### Responsiveness Test
Tests for mobile devices was made at [Googles Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).

Manual testing has also been done through the development. That has been done on mobile devices and in [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools).
Screens from 2560px down to 375px has been tested.

### Accessibility Testing
Accessibility was tested using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

At first, Lighthouse warned that there was not enough contrast between text and background. So i changed a color so that it passed.

### Validator Testing
The site is tested with [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for the HTML and for the CSS with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
For the JavaScript [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used.

Here is the results for CSS and HTML:

The validation through JSHint showed no errors. There was some warnings for older browsers.
At first it showed some warnings for missing semicolons and a variable that i forgot that was unused. But that is now solved.

### Logic Testing
There was a lot of testing done for the logic of the game. Most was made manually by myself, and by friends and family that would try the game and find things that was not working as it supposed to do.

Testing was also done by [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools). It was of big help when trying to find issues, especially in the JavaScript.

## Bugs
### Solved
- Card animation will only work first time it is clicked. The bug was fixed by adding a remove class of the flipped cards in the function that check for pairs.

- If you clicked more than two cards before they flipped back, it resulted in a error. The bug was fixed by adding a lock to the board while the timeout was running.

- You could click on a card that is already facing up wich will get the count for matches to count wrong. It was also turning an already matched card to the wrong side. The issue was solved by adding a "clicklock" on all cards that was not showing the back preventing this from happening. 

- The alert shown when finishing the game was not showing the time used correctly. Instead of the time it showed "[object HTMLSpanElement]". The issue was fixed by adding a element property in the JS that was forgotten.

### Left to Solve
- There no known bugs at the moment.
