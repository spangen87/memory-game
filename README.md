# Teddy Memory Game
This is a Memory Game that has been inspired from my daughters stuffed animals. It is a simple but yet challenging memory game with eight pairs of cards.

The game targets to be a fun and challenging way to learn concentrate and remembering things for children. But it also a nice way for adults to relax.

## User Experience (UX)
### Wireframes
The wireframes was made before the project started to guide the design. Some changes are made.

## Features

## Technologies Used

## Testing

## Bugs
Card animation will only work first time it is clicked. The bug was fixed by adding a remove class of the flipped cards in the function that check for pairs.

If you clicked more than two cards before they flipped back, it resulted in a error. The bug was fixed by adding a lock to the board while the timeout was running.
